This is our Story!

There once was a little boy named Jabbar. He was five years old and really
liked the circus. He was from Morrocco and lived with his family and their 
dog. 

One day Jabbar was practicing his flying acrobatics to prepare for his performance at the circus! He practice front flips and back flips. Then he slipped on a banana peel and fell in a pool! silly jabbar!
