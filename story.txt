This is our story!

There was a little boy from Morrocco names Jabbar. He only spoke Arabic and 
is five years old. He lives with his parents and his dog.

Jabbar is a right handed child who loves to play stick and hoop. Jabbar has
two siblings who love to spend time with him. But, one day Jabbar got lost
and ended up at the circus! His family misses him....

One day, catastrophe struck. Jabbar was running through the city streets then fell into a well! Luckily for Jabbar his dog, Sassy, was able to alert the nearby guards so he can be saved! Unfortunately, he broke his arm!
